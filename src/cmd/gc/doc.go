Gc is the generic label for the family of Go compilers
that function as part of the (modified) Plan 9 tool chain.  The C compiler
documentation at

	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/comp.pdf     (Tools overview)
	http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/compiler.pdf (C compiler architecture)

gives the overall design of the tool chain.  Aside from a few adapted pieces,
such as the optimizer, the Go compilers are wholly new programs.

The compiler reads in a set of Go files, typically suffixed ".go".  They
must all be part of one package.  The output is a single intermediate file
representing the "binary assembly" of the compiled package, ready as input
for the linker (6l, etc.).

The generated files contain type information about the symbols exported by
the package and about types used by symbols imported by the package from
other packages. It is therefore not necessary when compiling client C of
package P to read the files of P's dependencies, only the compiled output
of P.

Usage:
	6g [flags] file...
The specified files must be Go source files and all part of the same package.
Substitute 6g with 8g or 5g where appropriate.

Flags:
	-o file
		output file, default file.6 for 6g, etc.
	-e
		normally the compiler quits after 10 errors; -e prints all errors
	-p path
		assume that path is the eventual import path for this code,
		and diagnose any attempt to import a package that depends on it.
	-L
		show entire file path when printing line numbers in errors
	-I dir1 -I dir2
		add dir1 and dir2 to the list of paths to check for imported packages
	-N
		disable optimizations
	-S
		write assembly language text to standard output
	-u
		disallow importing packages not marked as safe
	-V
		print the compiler version

There are also a number of debugging flags; run the command with no arguments
to get a usage message.
